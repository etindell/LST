        <p>This is the beginning of something great!
            Welcome to L's message board!

            My first message is: 

            This will be website where people can share book reccomendations and reviews.

            Only people from the Academy 24'25 will be able to use the website (there will 
            be a password, but I haven't figured out how to add it yet).

            If you are not from the Academy 24'25, please leave the website.

            My first book reccomendation is:

            The Cogheart Series by Peter Bunzl.
